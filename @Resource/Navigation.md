# withNavigation 
higher-order component (HOC) was available in React Navigation v4 

## React Navigation v5 and Later (v6, v7):
- withNavigation was removed and replaced by the useNavigation hook for functional components.

## why remove ?
- React Navigation shifted towards a hook-based API starting from v5, making it more modern and functional.
