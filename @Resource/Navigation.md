# withNavigation 
higher-order component (HOC) was available in React Navigation v4 

## React Navigation v5 and Later (v6, v7):
- withNavigation was removed and replaced by the useNavigation hook for functional components.

## why remove ?
- React Navigation shifted towards a hook-based API starting from v5, making it more modern and functional.

# let id = navigation.getParam("id");
## using useRoute() hook
- The navigation.getParam() method was part of React Navigation 3 and earlier versions. 
- It has been deprecated in newer versions of React Navigation (starting with version 5) because the navigation API underwent significant changes to enhance flexibility and provide better control.
